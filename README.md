Commit Hash for Assessment: #180cf88

Total Working Time: ~8 hours (3 allotted)

Would improve:

- abstracting forms and events (lots of copied code)
- renaming classes to fit with BEM or another real strategy
- header design
- adding images to folders directly
- font and style consistency and standardization

Proud of:

- buttons that replace themselves with forms (but not how they're coded)
- accomplished optional tasks
- used html symbols where possible instead of images
